<!--                                       The difference between HTML and XHTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to create web pages. However, there are a few key differences between the two:
1. Syntax: HTML has a more lenient syntax, allowing for unclosed tags or attributes, while XHTML is stricter, requiring all tags to be properly closed and attributes to have values.
2. Document Type Declaration: HTML uses a document type declaration (DTD), while XHTML uses an XML declaration.
3. Tag Naming Conventions: XHTML requires that all tags be lowercase and properly nested, while HTML allows uppercase letters and some tags to be self-closing.
4. Error Handling: If HTML contains syntax errors, browsers will attempt to interpret and render the content. However, if XHTML contains errors, it will not be rendered at all.
Overall, XHTML is considered a more rigid and structured markup language compared to HTML.


                                                   Versions of HTML
There are several versions of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), each with its own set of specifications and improvements. Here are some of the 1. HTML 1.0: The first version of HTML was released in 1993.
2. HTML 2.0: It was released in 1995 and introduced support for tables, image maps, and form elements.
3. HTML 3.2: Released in 1997 and added support for style sheets, frames, and improved table support.
4. HTML 4.01: Released in 1999 and included new features like internationalization, scripting, and better support for multimedia.
5. XHTML 1.0: Released in 2000, it is an extension of HTML 4.01 that follows stricter rules of XML.
6. HTML5: The latest version of HTML, released in 2014, includes several new features such as improved multimedia support, new structural elements, and more sophisticated forms.
Each version builds upon the previous one's capabilities while introducing new features and improvements.


                                                   There are three versions of XHTML
1. XHTML 1.0 - This version was the first release of XHTML and was based on HTML 4.01. It was released in 2000 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
2. XHTML 1.1 - This version was released in 2001 and made some changes to XHTML 1.0, including removing the target attribute from links and adding support for Ruby annotations.
3. XHTML 2.0 - This version was planned as the successor to XHTML 1.x but was never released due to lack of industry adoption. It focused on modularization and updating the language to reflect modern web technologies.
